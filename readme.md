## Tr Constructor to-do:

- auto init a `tr` if `tr_add` is called first.
- checks to make sure the settings are sensible, i.e., `ctrl=0` if `reset = TRUE`.
- less type-switching! start in matrix type, then stay there.
- use additional columns to indicate things like init number or training vs. test set. this will make analysis *much* easier.
- add "presets" for difference phases (i.e., option-sets for training vs test).
